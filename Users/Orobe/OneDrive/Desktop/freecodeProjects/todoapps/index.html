      <!-- Explanation of Bitcoin Halving -->
      <div class="halving-explanation">
        <h2>What is <span class="btc-rainbow">Bitcoin</span> Halving?</h2>
        <p>
          The <span class="btc-rainbow">Bitcoin</span> Halving is a
          pre-programmed event that reduces the reward given to crypto miners by
          half approximately every four years. The Halving is essential because
          it ensures that the supply of
          <span class="btc-rainbow">Bitcoin</span> is kept in check and prevents
          inflation. The reduction of mining rewards means that the demand for
          <span class="btc-rainbow">Bitcoin</span> is expected to increase, and
          its value is likely to surge in response. It is anticipated to happen
          every 210,000 blocks or roughly every four years, with the most recent
          halving occurred in May 2020, reducing the reward from 12.5 to 6.25
          BTC per block. The <span class="btc-rainbow">Bitcoin</span> Halving
          plays a crucial role in the long-term viability and scarcity of
          <span class="btc-rainbow">Bitcoin</span>.

        <h3>November 28th, 2012: The First Slice</h3>
        <p>BTC Price: $12.20</p>
        <p>
          The first halving sliced off the first 50% of the Bitcoin mining
          reward â€“ from 50 to 25 Bitcoins per block. Back then, the impact of
          the halving was still not priced in. The community was watching
          anxiously, as the closing price on the halving day was ($12.20). In
          the months after the first halving in 2012, the network hash rate and
          difficulty declined as less profitable miners turned off machines to
          reduce costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, by early 2013, Bitcoin kicked off its first major bull run,
          surging from $13 to over $1,000 by year's end. The fears of miner
          capitulations were proven largely unfounded. The network hummed along,
          and the Bitcoin community learned an early lesson: Halvings are
          bullish for the Bitcoin network and the price of Bitcoin.

        <h3>July 9th, 2016: The Block Reward Halved Again</h3>
        <p>BTC Price: $657.57</p>
        <p>
          The second halving took place on July 9th, 2016. The reward for mining
          a block was cut in half, from 25 to 12.5 BTC. Following the halving,
          Bitcoin's price saw a gradual increase over the next year, eventually
          reaching new all-time highs in December 2017.

        <h3>May 11th, 2020: Halving Amidst a Global Pandemic</h3>
        <p>BTC Price: $8,721.76</p>
        <p>
          The third Bitcoin halving occurred on May 11th, 2020, amidst the
          COVID-19 pandemic. The block reward was reduced from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC.
          Despite initial concerns about the pandemic's impact on Bitcoin's
          price, the halving event was followed by a significant rally in the
          cryptocurrency market.

        <p>BTC Price: TBD</p>
        <p>
          The next Bitcoin halving is scheduled to occur in 2024. As with
          previous halvings, there is anticipation and speculation about its
          potential impact on the price and the overall Bitcoin ecosystem.
