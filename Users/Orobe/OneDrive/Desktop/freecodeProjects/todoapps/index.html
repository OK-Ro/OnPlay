        <!-- Explanation of Bitcoin Halving -->
        <div class="halving-explanation">
          <h2>What is <span class="btc-rainbow">Bitcoin</span> Halving?</h2>
          <p>
            The <span class="btc-rainbow">Bitcoin</span> Halving is a pre-programmed event that reduces the reward
            given to crypto miners by half approximately every four years. The
            Halving is essential because it ensures that the supply of <span class="btc-rainbow">Bitcoin</span> is
            kept in check and prevents inflation. The reduction of mining rewards
            means that the demand for <span class="btc-rainbow">Bitcoin</span> is expected to increase, and its
            value is likely to surge in response. It is anticipated to happen
            every 210,000 blocks or roughly every four years, with the most
            recent halving occurred in May 2020, reducing the reward from 12.5 to
            6.25 BTC per block. The <span class="btc-rainbow">Bitcoin</span> Halving plays a crucial role in the
            long-term viability and scarcity of <span class="btc-rainbow">Bitcoin</span>.
