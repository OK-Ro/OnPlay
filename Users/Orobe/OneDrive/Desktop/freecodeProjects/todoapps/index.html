      <h2>A Look Back at Bitcoin Halvings</h2>
      <p>
        The Bitcoin block reward halves every 210,000 blocks or approximately
        every 4 years. This regular reduction in Bitcoin's inflation rate is
        called the "halving".
      </p>
      <h3>Nov 28th, 2012: The First Slice</h3>
      <p>BTC Price: $12.20</p>
      <p>
        The first halving sliced off the first 50% of the Bitcoin mining reward
        – from 50 to 25 Bitcoins per block. Back then, the impact of the halving
        was still not priced in. The community was watching anxiously, as the
        closing price on the halving day was ($12.20). In the months after the
        first halving in 2012, the network hash rate and difficulty declined as
        less profitable miners turned off machines to reduce costs.

      <h2>2024 and Beyond</h2>
      <p>
        The next halving, who would’ve guessed it, will reduce the mining reward
        again – to 3.125 BTC per block. The Bitcoin community is eagerly
        anticipating this milestone. It will make Bitcoin’s supply even scarcer
        and, hopefully, introduce a new bull market.
